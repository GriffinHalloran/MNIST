# MNIST

These are two programs I wrote for MNIST classification. The first one, mnist.py is a simple solution that doesn't use any form of neural network to solve. The second file, keras-MNIST.py is another attempt but this time using keras to build the framework for a neural network. More information about the structure of these programs can be found on my blog, griffinhalloran.com/blog/
